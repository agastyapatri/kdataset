# **The OklamAI Dataset**
_A Dataset of Kendrick Lamar's lyricism._

**The text corpus used to train the network is located at `OklamAI/corpus/lyrics/KDOT.txt`**


I'm not aware of any text dataset which condenses all of Kendrick Lamar's verses. Before any RNN can be made, I need to collect all of his works into a single txt file. To keep things simple (and avoid any deviation from his lyrical style), I'm avoiding any of his features in other artists' songs. His oeuvre is considerably smaller than someone like, say, Jay-Z and it is still to be seen if the smaller size of the text corpus will result in poor  generalization. However, other artists' features in his songs will be kept. My assumption is that the features still adhere to lyrical themes and the rhythmic schemes of the whole song.
