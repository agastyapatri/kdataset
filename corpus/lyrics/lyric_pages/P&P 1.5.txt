"Gina, baby, I don't have no money, I don't have no ends
Gina, I'm ass-out"
"I'm going through something right now!"
"I done told you that"

[Kendrick Lamar:]
Oh, what up ho? Oh, what up?
I said, oh, what up ho? Oh, what up?
I said, oh, what up ho? Oh, what up?
Well, alright

I'm going through something with life
But pussy and PatrÃ³n make you feel alright
Pussy and PatrÃ³n make you feel alright
Pussy and PatrÃ³n, that's some great advice

I'm going through something with life
But pussy and PatrÃ³n make you feel alright
Pussy and PatrÃ³n make you feel alright
Pussy and PatrÃ³n, that's some great advice

Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than society's
Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit, love
I want diamonds, too: Ronnie on Player's Club
I used to have a nine-to-five; fresh out of schoolâthat was '05
That bitch was racist, got me fired
Ever since then, I had no job
Pushing in my mamma van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me, these niggas rushed me for something my cousin prolly did
Guilty by association: story of my life, nigga
You gon' make me flip and split your shit, judge give me life, nigga
Pain since my grandma's death, Uncle killed at Louie's Burgers
Hold my tears, I tried my best; let it go, drench my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist, tryna go beyond the marginâ margin
Maintaining my modestâ modest as I dream
So while I go through all thisâ all this bullshit, what you call it
Life itself, I know what helps, let me scroll through my Blackberry
("Hey, what's up, daddy?")

I'm going through something with life
But pussy and PatrÃ³n make you feel alright
Pussy and PatrÃ³n make you feel alright
Pussy and PatrÃ³n, that's some great advice

I'm going through something with life
But pussy and PatrÃ³n make you feel alright
Pussy and PatrÃ³n make you feel alright

[Part II]

"So what'd you rush me over here for?
How was your day?
Are you tipsy?"

"Mhm!"

[Kendrick Lamar:]
All I need in this lifetime: pussy and PatrÃ³n
Give me that, once you give me that, once again, it's on
Bitch, I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that Screw
Coming down clean, tell your baby mamma, "What it do?"
Where your friends at? I got long dickâwhat it is?
Go'n' poke it out, situate your little positives
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, already
I'ma lay it down like a carpenter when you let me

Give me that funk
That sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
I can't get enough
If I offend you, blame it on the liquor, babe
Give me that funk
That sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
I can't get enough
If I offend you

Ugh, I wrote this song when Dave drove home
And caught that flat in the mean T-Flats
And it made me think if we could blink
To change locations where we at
We often get lost in the alcohol bottle
In attempt to ignore pain, problem, and sorrow
Just for a minute, then back to the bullshit
Your car note due, and you 'bout to get evicted
Two drugs, surely, PatrÃ³n, pussy, make it feel alright
But once it's empty and that bitch leave, then it's back to life
You can't run from it, gotta run to it, nigga
The antidote wouldn't last, and you knew it, nigga
But still, you proceed to dive deep, ask what's her Zodiac sign

I'm going through something with life
But pussy and PatrÃ³n make you feel alright
Pussy and PatrÃ³n make you feel alright
Pussy and PatrÃ³n, that's some great advice

I'm going through something with life
But pussy and PatrÃ³n make you feel alright
Pussy and PatrÃ³n make you feel alright
Pussy and PatrÃ³n, that's some great advice

[Ab-Soul:]
Okay, welcome to my diaryâhmm, where should I begin?
Finna get a Swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step; man, I hate to work for them
One time, I tried to work for me, but that shit didn't work for me
And here I am, stressing, questioning my direction man
What to do? Nothing's moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it
Pop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open
Bust that pussy open, bust that pussy open
(Soul!) Balls deep, you dig?
Retrieve relief, you dig?
Let's kill a bottle of tequila
And lie butt-naked telling the truth, would you?
What's up?
I had a long day, and I really wanna fuck
Take a double-shot to the face and forget about my whole day
'Cause all I've been thinking the whole day (Whole day, whole day)
