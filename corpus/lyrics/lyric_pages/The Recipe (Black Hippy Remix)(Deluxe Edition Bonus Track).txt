[ScHoolboy Q:]
Every morning nigga I get blazed, aye
Women, weed, and weather nigga if you bored come and join the wave, aye
Girl what is your name 'cause I'm feeling your frame, can I see what you 'bout, uh
A little something in your rear, little something in your mouth, little something on your couch, uh

She said she like it from the back like a real bitch, uh

Yo I can't reply, she curled my toes and crossed my eyes
But when you got the recipe it's no surprise
Bad hoes panties get left behind, I want your behind

We want to be on, to peak on the chart
So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
